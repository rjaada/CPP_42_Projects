Understanding memory management is a critical skill in C++. Manual memory control gives the programmer great power, but also great responsibility. A common issue is the memory leak, which occurs when dynamic memory is allocated but never freed. This kind of memory mismanagement can cause a program to slow down and eventually crash.

To avoid memory problems, one must be diligent. Every 'new' must have a matching 'delete'. This applies to single allocations of memory and array allocations of memory. The rules of memory are strict. Forgetting to free memory is a serious bug.

Good memory hygiene leads to stable and efficient applications. Tracking every piece of dynamic memory is not always easy, but tools like Valgrind can help detect memory errors. Proper C++ memory handling is a sign of a skilled developer.
